### World Layout

```
[Start] -------- [Merchants] -------- [Platforms] -------- [Fortress] -------- [King]
x=3000           x=4000-8000          x=5000-20000         x=24000-27000      x=26000
```

**Starting Area (x=3000):**
- Player spawn point
- Safe area with walls

**Merchant Zone (x=4000-8000):**
- Weapons Merchant at x=4000
- Explosives Merchant at x=8000
- Buy supplies here (future feature)

**Platform Challenges (x=5000-20000):**
- Scattered platforms for navigation
- Practice movement and jumping
- Good place to earn money from blocks

**Enemy Fortress (x=24000-27000):**
- Heavily fortified with steel and stone
- 5 Guards patrolling the area
- Multiple rooms and corridors
- King at the center (x=26000)

### Strategy Tips

1. **Start Slow**: Practice movement and jumping in the starting area

2. **Earn Money**: Destroy blocks in the platform section to build up funds

3. **Buy Explosives**: Use TNT to clear paths through the fortress
   - Each TNT costs $200
   - Strategic placement is key
   - Can destroy multiple blocks at once

4. **Avoid Guards**: Enemy guards patrol the fortress
   - They can damage you
   - Try to avoid direct confrontation
   - Use explosives from a distance

5. **Find the King**: Located deep in the fortress at x=26000
   - Heavily protected by walls
   - Requires multiple explosives to reach
   - Defeating him wins the game!

6. **Manage Resources**: 
   - Balance spending on explosives vs saving money
   - Each block destroyed gives money back
   - Plan your route carefully

### Win Condition
Destroy enough blocks to reach the King and eliminate him!

### Lose Condition
Player health reaches 0 (fall damage, enemy attacks, etc.)
