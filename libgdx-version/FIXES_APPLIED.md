# LibGDX Version - Fixes Applied

This document describes the fixes applied to make the libGDX version match the original Android game.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Sprite Sheet Animation (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** Characters (player, guards, king, merchants) use animated sprite sheets (512x128 with 8 frames of 64x64 each), but the code was treating them as single static sprites.

**Fix:**
- Updated `GameEntity` base class to support `Animation<TextureRegion>` in addition to static sprites
- Modified `Player`, `Guard`, `King`, and `Merchant` to properly load and split sprite sheets
- Added animation time tracking and frame updates in `update()` methods
- Implemented proper sprite flipping for facing direction using negative width rendering (not texture flipping to avoid shared frame issues)

**Files Changed:**
- `entities/GameEntity.java` - Added animation support
- `entities/Player.java` - Sprite sheet loading with 8 frames
- `entities/Guard.java` - Sprite sheet loading with 8 frames
- `entities/King.java` - Sprite sheet loading with 8 frames
- `entities/Merchant.java` - Sprite sheet loading with 8 frames

### 2. World Coordinate System (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** Original game uses `tileSize * 3 = 192px` per tile, but libGDX version was using 64px directly, causing massive scale mismatches.

**Fix:**
- Changed `TILE_SIZE` constant from 64f to 192f to match original
- Kept `BLOCK_SIZE` at 64f for individual block rendering
- Each 192x192 tile position now generates 3x3 blocks (64x64 each) to properly fill the space
- This matches the original game's sprite scale factor of `1.15` and tiling approach

**Files Changed:**
- `world/GameWorld.java` - Updated TILE_SIZE constant and block generation

### 3. Terrain Layer Generation (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** Layers were positioned incorrectly, causing player to spawn in mid-air or underground.

**Fix:**
- Calculated proper grass level at y=2800 (just below player spawn at y=2848)
- Generated 6 layers (bedrock, stone, stone, dirt, dirt, grass) from bottom to top
- Each layer is 192px tall, filled with 3 rows of 64px blocks
- Terrain now spans entire map width with proper horizontal and vertical tiling

**Files Changed:**
- `world/GameWorld.java` - Complete terrain generation rewrite

### 4. World Structure Layout (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** LibGDX used simplified procedural generation instead of the original's detailed 2D array layout.

**Fix:**
- Ported original 14-row × 78-column world layout array
- Implemented proper mirroring for both teams (left and right sides)
- Each array position creates appropriate blocks or NPCs:
  - Block types (1=brick, 6=steel, 9=planks, 4-5=wool)
  - NPCs (10=demolist, 11=blockseller, 12=weaponclerk, 14=guard, 15=king)
- Structure positioned above ground level with proper vertical offset

**Files Changed:**
- `world/GameWorld.java` - Added `generateWorld()` and `placeWorldObjects()` methods

### 5. Player Spawn Position
**Problem:** Coordinates were correct (2974, 2848) but terrain was wrong, making spawn position unusable.

**Fix:** 
- No change needed to spawn coordinates
- Fixed terrain to make spawn position valid (see terrain fixes above)

**Files Changed:**
- `screens/GameScreen.java` - Added comment clarifying spawn position

### 6. Touch Controls for Mobile (IMPORTANT)
**Problem:** Only keyboard controls existed, making the game unplayable on Android.

**Fix:**
- Added `handleTouchInput()` method with multi-touch support (up to 5 fingers)
- Touch zones:
  - Left 1/3 of screen: move left
  - Right 1/3 of screen: move right  
  - Top 1/3 of screen: jump
  - Bottom-right corner: place explosive
- Integrated with existing keyboard controls for desktop compatibility

**Files Changed:**
- `screens/GameScreen.java` - Added `handleTouchInput()` method

### 7. Camera/Viewport Positioning (IMPORTANT)
**Problem:** Camera centered player exactly in middle of screen, unlike original which positioned player at 1/3 from left.

**Fix:**
- Updated camera positioning to place player at 1/3 from left and 1/3 from bottom
- Matches original's `setPlayerPositionOnScreen(2, 2)` behavior
- Increased viewport size to 2400×1600 (from 1920×1080) for better world visibility
- Adjusted font scale to 3f for better readability

**Files Changed:**
- `screens/GameScreen.java` - Updated camera positioning logic and viewport size

### 8. Physics Tuning (MINOR)
**Problem:** Gravity felt too weak compared to original.

**Fix:**
- Increased gravity from -30f to -50f for better game feel
- Makes jumping and falling more responsive

**Files Changed:**
- `screens/GameScreen.java` - Updated World creation

### 9. UI Improvements (MINOR)
**Problem:** UI text was too small and didn't explain mobile controls.

**Fix:**
- Increased font scale from 2f to 3f
- Added mobile control instructions
- Updated control help text with both desktop and mobile instructions

**Files Changed:**
- `screens/GameScreen.java` - Updated `renderUI()` method

## Technical Details

### Coordinate System
- **World dimensions:** 30000 × 4000 units
- **Tile size:** 192 × 192 units (matching original tileSize * 3)
- **Block size:** 64 × 64 units (actual rendered size)
- **Sprite sizes:** 
  - Character sprite sheets: 512×128 (8 frames of 64×64)
  - Block textures: 64×64
- **Player spawn:** (2974, 2848) in world coordinates
- **Grass level:** y=2800 (48 units below player spawn)

### Scaling Ratios
- Original uses Android screen pixels with a sprite scale factor
- LibGDX uses world units directly
- 1 original tile = 192 world units = 3×3 blocks of 64 units each
- This maintains the visual scale and proportions of the original game

### World Layout
- 78 columns × 14 rows of tiles (192×192 each)
- Total structure width: 14976 units per side
- Two mirrored sides for team 0 and team 1
- Total used width: ~30000 units (matches MAP_WIDTH)

## Testing Notes

To test the fixes:
1. Build and run the libGDX version
2. Verify player spawns on solid ground (not floating or underground)
3. Check that player sprite is animated (walking animation)
4. Test keyboard controls: WASD/arrows for movement, Space for jump
5. Test touch controls on Android: tap sides to move, top to jump
6. Verify structures are visible and properly scaled
7. Test placing TNT with F key or bottom-right tap
8. Verify guards and king are animated and positioned correctly

## Known Limitations

- Doors, ladders, and poles from original layout are not yet implemented (IDs 2, 3, 8, 13)
- Explosion damage radius calculation is not fully implemented
- Some advanced features from original (inventory system, shop interactions) are simplified

## Performance Considerations

The terrain generation creates many blocks (up to 9 per tile position). For optimization:
- Consider using merged collision shapes for adjacent static blocks
- Implement frustum culling to only render visible entities
- Use object pooling for frequently created/destroyed entities
- The current approach prioritizes correctness over optimization
