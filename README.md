# DemolitionWars
Strategical conquest game I made originally targeting Android 2 Froyo, but recently decided to revamp for Android 15 using Claude.

The idea of the game is to strategically use monetary resources to, ideally, kill the opposing king.

How it works:
- You start with 1000 moolah
- The king is protected behind a bunch of walls and guards.
- You can buy weapons and bombs
- The game has a cool physics system
